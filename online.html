          <h2 class="media-heading">Codeforces</h2>
          <p>Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests. It is maintained by a group of competitive programmers from ITMO University led by Mikhail Mirzayanov. Since 2013, Codeforces claims to surpass Topcoder in terms of active contestants. As of 2018, it has over 600,000 registered users.</p>
          <p>How does codeforces rating work?
            The basic idea of Codeforces rating system is to generalize Elo rating to support games with multiple participants. Each community member is characterized by value r i — integer number. Roughly speaking, the higher value means better results in the contests.</p>
        <p>How do I prepare for codeforces?
            Learning to code is all about practicing. Participate regularly in the programming contests. Solve the ones that you cannot solve in the contest, after the contest. Apart from Topcoder and Codeforces you can also look at HackerEarth Challengesor Codechef contests.</p>
        <p>What is skipped in codeforces?
            0. It happens in two scenarios : 1) You resubmit a solution to one of your previously "pretest passed" submissions, in that case only the last submitted solution will be judged and all prior submissions will be skipped.</p>
        <p>How do I increase codeforces rating?
            Pick the topic in which you failed. Solve problems on the topic till 800~ submissions. ( It get's out of my comfort zone whenever I start solving problems with <1000 submissions). I am many times unable to solve problems ahead! )</p>
        <p>How do I practice ICPC?
            Do Participate in their monthly contests to remain up to the mark.
            ACM-ICPC Past Problems – ICPC Archive, Practice at Codechef.
            TopCoder – Proceed by increasing problem levels gradually.
            Codeforces -List of Problem Sets.
            Codechef – Beginers can start with Codechef Beginners and proceed further.</p>

      <p>What Is LeetCode? It's a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 800+ questions (and growing), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.</p>
<p>What is LeetCode used for?
    LeetCode is for software engineers who are looking to practice with technical questions and advance their skills. Mastering the questions in each level on LeetCode is a good way to prepare for technical interviews and keep your skills sharp..</p>
<p>Is LeetCode good for interviews?
    Leetcode is definitely one of the most effective resources to prepare technical interviews. The idea is that you certainly need a bunch of practice before you can easily solve those problems. From my experience, after practicing tons of coding questions, I soon found that most of them are similar in many ways.</p>

     <p>Is HackerRank good for interviews?
        Hackerrank is more useful in coding round of selection and geekforgeeks in interview round. For example , in hacker rank you can practice hundreds of dynamic programming problems, find common method of solving them and time your effort in the process. ... Learn from geekforgeeks and practice in hackerrank.</p>

    <p>Topcoder (formerly TopCoder) is a crowdsourcing company with an open global community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers. Topcoder pays community members for their work on the projects and sells community services to corporate, mid-size, and small-business clients..</p>
   <p>Is TopCoder good for beginners?
    CodeChef is probably better than TopCoder for beginners. Although there are enough practice problems of all difficulty levels on both the websites, the Long CodeChef contest is quite a nice format. ... CodeChef is also a growing platform, whereas I think TopCoder SRMs is a dying platform.</p>
